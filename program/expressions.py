#1: This is how you use assignment operators:
x = 5



#2:You can add/subtract/multiply/divide with an assigment operator, like this:
y=50
y -=20
y *=3
y /= 4


#3:You can compare two equations with a comparison operator like this:
a= 3
b =4
c = a > b

#4: You can add/sub/mul/div numbers in a expression. like this:
d=5
f = (d/4) *30 + 35
